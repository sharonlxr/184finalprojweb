Abstract</h2>
A paragraph summary of the entire project.
<p>In this final project, we simulate fluid movement via particle-based postion simulation. To enhence the experience with fluid simulation, we incorporate many interactive elements to make the fluid movement various and illustrate some technical parts. In this project, there are a lot of searching for existing materials, testing and improvement. Overall, we think we have a good experience developing a nice fluid simulation. </p>
<h2>Technical approach</h2>
A 1-2 page summary of your technical approach, techniques used, algorithms implemented, etc. (use references to papers or other resources for further detail). Highlight how your approach varied from the references used (did you implement a subset, or did you change or enhance anything), the unique decisions you made and why.
A description of problems encountered and how you tackled them.
A description of lessons learned.
<h2>Results</h2>
Your final images, animations, video of your system (whichever is relevant). You can include results that you think show off what you built but that you did not have time to go over on presentation day.
<h2>References</h2>
<h2>Contributions from each team member</h2>
A clear description of the work contributed by each team member.
