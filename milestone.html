  <h2>3D fluids simulations and Snow Simulation</h2>

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>At this milestone, we have successfully implemented the simulation of simple 3D fluid. Our method is based on the Smooth Particles Hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate fluids with free surface. To this end, we derive the viscosity and pressure force fields directly from the Navier-Stokes equation, and have tried a few smoothing kernel function to better simulate the interaction between pair of particles. </p>

  <h3> Overview of Program Structure </h3>
  <p> Our current implementation iterates through all particles, computes total force acting on each particle, and applies the verlet integration to update the velocity and position of each particle. </p>

  <h3> What we have achieved </h3>
  <p>At this milstone, we are able to simulate simple fluid movement using particle-based system. The use of particles simplies a stationary grid-based system, as we assume each particle has constant mass and thus guarantee mass conservation. It further simplifies the Navier-Stokes equations, eliminating some complex terms such as the convective term "v*&nabla;v". Thus, using the particle based system, there are only three terms left for the Navier-Stokes equations: force = -&nabla;p + &rho;g + u&nabla;<sub>2</sub></p>
  <p> At the beginning of each simulation iteration, we first found the neighboring particles and then use them to calculate particle's density and pressure. Particle's density is evaluated through the following equation:</p>
  <p align = "center" > <img src="density_equation.png" width="150px" /> </p>
  <p> We then use the density to calcuate pressure acting on each particles. We find the Tait equation fit to use here:</p>

    <p align = "center" > <img src="pressure_equation.png" width="150px" /> </p>

  <p> We hen use the density and pressure value to further compute the pressure force and viscocity force acting on each particle. The equations we use are given below, where v<sub>i</sub> is the velocity of particle i.</p>
  <p align = "center" > <img src="forces_equation.png" width="270px" /> </p>
  <p> We have tried a few W[eight] function to apply in the above equations. For the sake of stability, we decide to use Debrun's spiky kernel function, in favor of the cubic spline kernel function, which tends to bluid particles into clusters under high pressure. The equation for Spiky kernal function is given below: </p>

        <p align = "center" > <img src="spiky.png" width="250px" /> </p>
  <p> Lastly, we sum over all the forces, including the gravity force, and use verlet integration to compute the new position and velocity for each particle </p>

  <h3> Reflection on Progress </h3>
  <ur>
    <li> We have finalized some key functions, such as the kernel function and the Navier-Stokes equation, etc. </li>
    <li> Basic fluid simulation is complete. For the next week we are going to further furnish our implementation, to make it more physically realistic. Features including the surface tension, collision force, etc. </li>
    <li> We will be trying to build snow simulation based on our current particle-based system. A starting approach is to build the particle-based system into a grid-clustered particle-based system. </li>
