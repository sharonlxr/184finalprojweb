3.1A Milestone Status Report Webpage (CS184 Students)

Create a short webpage for your milestone report. This should be about 1 page long if printed. You should briefly summarize what you have accomplished, preliminary results, reflect on progress relative to your plan, and update your work plan as appropriate. You must submit this milestone deliverable (and the final deliverable) on a persistent website that you can choose to keep up after class if you wish to present this work in your portfolio.

3.1B Milestone Status Report Webpage (CS284A Students)

If you are a CS284A student, read Section 5.1B for a description of how you will format your paper as a journal-style paper. For the milestone, download and familiarize yourself with the ACM SIGGRAPH paper template (you are encouraged to try using LaTeX). Format your milestone report in this template.

3.2 Milestone Video

A short 1-minute video summarizing your progress. The style of this milestone video is quite free. One idea is to make several slides with narration, showing the general idea and current progress. You can include some screenshots of code and images. You can also run your current program and record the screen to show us what is happening. Keep in mind that your video submission should clearly explain and demonstrate to us what you have achieved so far. Link this video on your webpage.

3.3 Presentation slides

2-3 slides summarizing your project and current progress. Link these on your webpage too.

3.4 Milestone Submission
	

<!-- Title, Summary and Team Members
Provide us a descriptive title, 2-3 sentences that summarize your project, and list your two team members.
Problem Description
Here you should provide the context for your idea. Describe the problem that you are trying to solve, why it is important, where it is challenging. Give us a general idea on how you are going to solve it.
Goals and Deliverables
This is the most important part of your proposal. You should carefully think through what you are trying to accomplish, what results you are going for, and why you think you can accomplish those goals. For example:
Since this is a graphics class you will likely define the kind of images you will create (e.g. including a photo of a new lighting effect you will simulate).
If you are working on an interactive system, describe what demo you will create.
Define how you will measure the quality / performance of your system (e.g. graphs showing speedup, or quantifying accuracy). It may not be possible to define precise target metrics at this time, but we encourage you to try.
What questions do you plan to answer with your analysis?
You should break this section into two parts: (1) what you plan to deliver, and (2) what you hope to deliver. In (1), describe what you believe you must accomplish to have a successful project and achieve the grade you expect (i.e. your baseline plan -- planning for some unexpected problems would make sense). In (2), describe what you hope to achieve if things go well and you get ahead of schedule (your aspirational plan).
Schedule
In this section you should organize and plan the tasks and subtasks that your team will execute. Since presentations are ~4 weeks from the due-date of the proposal, you should include a set of tasks for every week.
Resources
List what resources, e.g. books, papers and/or online resources that are references for your project. List the computing platform, hardware and software resources that you will use for your project. You have a wide latitude here to use what you have access to, but be aware that you will have to support and trouble-shoot on your platform yourselves. If you are starting from an existing piece of code or system, describe and provide a pointer to it here. -->
